# Blinkit_PowerBI_Dashboard
Developed a Blinkit Power BI Dashboard to visualize and analyze sales data.  The dashboard displays key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, average sales, average rating, and the number of items sold. It offers an interactive interface to track these metrics, providing valuable insights for data-driven decision-making and business optimization.
